# Agentic_AI
# 🌦️ Weather Forecast Agentic AI

An **autonomous AI agent** that intelligently retrieves, reasons, and responds to complex weather-related queries — beyond simple forecasts.

## 🧠 What is it?

Weather Forecast Agentic AI is built with an **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architecture and is capable of:

- 🌍 Pulling **real-time weather data** via web search
- 📚 Leveraging a **vector database** of historical climate data
- 🧭 **Routing queries** through intelligent gateways and planning steps
- 🤖 Providing **context-aware summaries**, suggestions, and alerts
- 🧑‍💻 Escalating to human-in-the-loop feedback in ambiguous cases

## 🔧 Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔍 Web Search Tool | For real-time forecasts from trusted sources |
| 📘 Knowledge Base | Embedded weather insights & historical trends (via VectorDB) |
| 🧠 Reasoning Layer | Agentic logic to synthesize forecast + user context |
| 🔄 Planning | Decides whether to search, retrieve, summarize, or ask user |
| 🧑‍⚖️ Human-in-the-loop | Optional verification layer for high-risk decisions |
